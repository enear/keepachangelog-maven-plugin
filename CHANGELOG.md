# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- When an unknown server was detected the release command would not
  complete but there is no logical reason for that to happen as a change
  log does not have to have a diff list. Instead if a server is unknown the
  release command simply does not write the diff list.

## [1.2.1] - 2017-08-18

### Fixed

- First version is not a reference link. All versions have a link comparing
  with the previous version but the first version as no previous version. So
  instead of having `## [1.0.0]` as a first version heading it should be `##
  1.0.0` instead.

## [1.2.0] - 2017-08-18

### Fixed

- Discrepancy in documentation.
- The version reference links should be comparing the previous version instead
  of the next version.
